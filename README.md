## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- A bit of Flex
- Desktop-first workflow

### Continued development

The grid is probably always going to be that one concept I won't fully be able to implement without a lot of checking and little changes. I will say that I don't think the grid I've created is 100% perfect, and that's fine. It leaves me work that I can focus and improve on in the future.
